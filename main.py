# Code to accompany the paper "Constructions in combinatorics via neural networks and LP solvers" by A Z Wagner
# Code for conjecture 2.1, without the use of numba 
#
# Please keep in mind that I am far from being an expert in reinforcement learning. 
# If you know what you are doing, you might be better off writing your own code.
#
# This code works on tensorflow version 1.14.0 and python version 3.6.3
# It mysteriously breaks on other versions of python.
# For later versions of tensorflow there seems to be a massive overhead in the predict function for some reason, and/or it produces mysterious errors.
# Debugging these was way above my skill level.
# If the code doesn't work, make sure you are using these versions of tf and python.
#
# I used keras version 2.3.1, not sure if this is important, but I recommend this just to be safe.
