# DualNeuralNet

This repository implements code to solve combinatorial problems using reinforcement learning
the ES folder modifies code by A Z Wagner : https://github.com/zawagner22/cross-entropy-for-combinatorics
the agents folder uses `tf-agents` and implements REINFORCE and DQN
 the code works with:
 ```
 python version 3.6
 numpy version 1.19.5
 tensorflow version 2.4.1
 ```
